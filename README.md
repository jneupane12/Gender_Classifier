The code uses the scikit-learn machine learning library to train a decision tree on a small dataset 
of body metrics (height, width, and shoe size) labeled male or female. 
Then we can predict the gender of someone given a novel set of body metrics.


Here we use 3 more classifiers from the sci-kit learn documentation and add them to the gender.py code. 
Train them on the same dataset and compare their results and determine accuracy.
